# Node Affinity

## PODs to Nodes

- Node Label
- Node Affinity

### Why Node Affinity is used more widely than Node Label ?

- Node Affinity is more powerful than Node Selector because it supports advanced expressions, multiple conditions, and
  soft constraints (preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution), making scheduling more flexible and intelligent.

### Node Affinity Declarations in Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: data-processor
      image: data-processor
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
              - key: size
                operator: In
                values:
                  - Large 
```

### Node Affinity Typeps

- Available:

`requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`
`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`

- Planned
  `requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution`


### Pod States 
- DuringScheduling: this means that the pod is not exist. 
- DuringExecution: this means that the pod has already been created.
